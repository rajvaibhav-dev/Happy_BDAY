# 🎂✨ Happy Birthday  ✨💻  
*A Code-Powered Birthday Gesture for Someone Special*  



---

## 🌟 **About This Project**  
I created this interactive birthday website for my crush to make her day extra special! It features:  
- 🎨 A beautifully decorated birthday card in the center of the screen.  
- 🎂 A big animated cake with festive GIFs.  
- ✨ Calligraphy-style "Happy Birthday" text.  
- 💌 A message icon that pops open with a heartfelt greeting when clicked.  

The website is fully responsive and designed to make her smile. 😊

## 🚀 **Why I Built This**  
Because why send a boring text when you can code a whole website, right? 😏  
This project is my way of combining my coding skills with a heartfelt gesture. Plus, it’s a fun and creative way to celebrate someone special!
